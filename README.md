# SIProject1
My first Systems Integration project from 2016. It consists of a web crawler implemented using Java, which publishes information from the Rio Olympic games on a JMS topic, which allows the other two components(Keeper and SummaryCreator) to use the information for their own purposes(respectively, handle the Requester's queries for medal info, and the generation of summaries in HTML, using XSLT).  

For more information, check the report.
